## Phase I — In-Memory Todo Console Application

### Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code



---



## 📌 Repository Information



**Project Repository:**

https://github.com/tahiralatif/Todo-App



This repository contains Phase I of the **"Evolution of Todo"** hackathon project.

The project strictly follows **Spec-Driven, AI-Native Development**, where the developer acts as a **System Architect** and AI (Claude Code) acts as the **implementation engine**.



---



## 🎯 Purpose & Intent of Phase I



Phase I exists to validate the ability to:

- Design software through **clear specifications**

- Guide AI to generate correct, maintainable code

- Build a clean, professional **console-based application**

- Demonstrate architectural thinking over manual coding



This phase intentionally avoids complexity (databases, APIs, cloud) and focuses on **foundational engineering discipline**.



---



## 🧠 Developer Role Definition



In this project:

- The **developer** is responsible for:

  - Writing specifications

  - Defining architecture

  - Reviewing AI output

  - Refining specs when behavior is incorrect

- **Claude Code** is treated as a junior engineer that:

  - Writes all production code

  - Follows instructions strictly from specs and constitution



---



## 🚫 Non-Negotiable Rules



### 1️⃣ No Manual Coding

- All source code **must be generated by Claude Code**

- Manual edits to any `.py` file are strictly forbidden

- Any correction must be done by **updating the specification**, not the code



### 2️⃣ Spec-First Workflow (Mandatory)

- Every feature must start with a **Markdown specification**

- Code generation happens only after the spec is approved

- Specs may be refined multiple times until correct behavior is achieved



### 3️⃣ Feature-Isolated Development

- Each feature must be developed in its **own Git branch**

- A Pull Request must be created per feature

- Direct commits to `main` are not allowed



### 4️⃣ Specification History Preservation

- Every feature has its own folder under `/specs`

- Spec evolution must be preserved to show reasoning and iteration



---



## 🧱 Architectural Principles



### 1️⃣ Object-Oriented Design (Mandatory)

The application must:

- Use well-defined Python classes

- Encapsulate data and behavior properly

- Avoid procedural or script-style logic

- Reflect real-world domain modeling (Tasks, TaskManager, CLIController, etc.)



### 2️⃣ Modular & Scalable Structure

- Code must be split into logical modules

- Each module should have a single responsibility

- Phase I structure must support future expansion without refactoring



### 3️⃣ Clean & Senior-Level Code Standards

All generated code must reflect:

- 10+ years of engineering maturity

- Clear naming conventions

- Predictable control flow

- Defensive programming practices

- Readable and maintainable structure



---



## 🎨 CLI User Experience Standards



The console application must provide a **polished and intentional CLI experience**.



### Required Libraries

- **Rich**

  - Styled output

  - Tables for task listing

  - Status indicators and colored feedback

- **Questionary**

  - Interactive prompts

  - Menu-driven command selection

  - User-friendly confirmations and inputs



### UX Expectations

- No raw `print()`-based interfaces

- No unstructured text output

- The CLI should feel professional, intuitive, and accessible



---



## ⚙️ Technology Constraints



- **Language:** Python 3.13+

- **Package Manager:** `uv`

- **Project Initialization:**

  ```bash

  uv init

## Response snapshot

Created initial constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:
- Developer Role Definition section
- Non-Negotiable Rules (No Manual Coding, Spec-First Workflow, Feature-Isolated Development, Specification History Preservation)
- Architectural Principles (OOP, Modular Structure, Senior-Level Code Standards)
- CLI UX Standards (Rich and Questionary libraries)
- Technology Constraints (Python 3.13+, uv)
- Project Structure (phase_1 folder organization)
- Governance section with versioning and amendment process

Version: 0.1.0

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution created successfully at .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (constitution creation)
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for feature specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: User requested constitution at existing path, not root level

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
