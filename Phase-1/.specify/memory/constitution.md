# Constitution.md

## Phase I — In-Memory Todo Console Application

### Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code

---

## Repository Information

**Project Repository:** https://github.com/tahiralatif/Todo_App

This https://github.com/tahiralatif/Todo_App repository contains Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon project. The project strictly follows Spec-Driven, AI-Native Development, where the developer acts as a System Architect and AI (Claude Code) acts as the implementation engine.

---

## Purpose & Intent of Phase I

Phase I exists to validate the ability to:

- Design software through **clear specifications**
- Guide AI to generate correct, maintainable code
- Build a clean, professional **console-based application**
- Demonstrate architectural thinking over manual coding

This phase intentionally avoids complexity (databases, APIs, cloud) and focuses on **foundational engineering discipline**.

---

## Developer Role Definition

In this project:

- The **developer** is responsible for:
  - Writing specifications
  - Defining architecture
  - Reviewing AI output
  - Refining specs when behavior is incorrect

- **Claude Code** is treated as a junior engineer that:
  - Writes all production code
  - Follows instructions strictly from specs and constitution

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. No Manual Coding

- All source code **must be generated by Claude Code**
- Manual edits to any `.py` file are strictly forbidden
- Any correction must be done by **updating the specification**, not the code

### 2. Spec-First Workflow (Mandatory)

- Every feature must start with a **Markdown specification**
- Code generation happens only after the spec is approved
- Specs may be refined multiple times until correct behavior is achieved

### 3. Feature-Isolated Development

- Each feature must be developed in its **own Git branch**
- A Pull Request must be created per feature
- Direct commits to `main` are not allowed

### 4. Specification History Preservation

- Every feature has its own folder under `/specs/phase_1/`
- Spec evolution must be preserved to show reasoning and iteration

---

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Object-Oriented Design (Mandatory)

The application must:
- Use well-defined Python classes
- Encapsulate data and behavior properly
- Avoid procedural or script-style logic
- Reflect real-world domain modeling (Tasks, TaskManager, CLIController, etc.)

### 2. Modular & Scalable Structure

- Code must be split into logical modules
- Each module should have a single responsibility
- Phase I structure must support future expansion without refactoring

### 3. Clean & Senior-Level Code Standards

All generated code must reflect:
- 10+ years of engineering maturity
- Clear naming conventions
- Predictable control flow
- Defensive programming practices
- Readable and maintainable structure

---

## CLI User Experience Standards

The console application must provide a **polished and intentional CLI experience**.

### Required Libraries

**Rich**:
- Styled output
- Tables for task listing
- Status indicators and colored feedback

**Questionary**:
- Interactive prompts
- Menu-driven command selection
- User-friendly confirmations and inputs

### UX Expectations

- No raw `print()`-based interfaces
- No unstructured text output
- The CLI should feel professional, intuitive, and accessible

---

## Technology Constraints

- **Language:** Python 3.13+
- **Package Manager:** `uv`
- **Project Initialization:** `uv init`
